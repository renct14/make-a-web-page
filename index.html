					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-1-1">The Web</h3>
						<p>The web are numerous computers communicating with each other. Through your browser (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) you can send <i>HTTP requests</i> to servers through the internet. That server will then fetch and return the appropriate <i>HTML documents</i>, which your web browser will interpret and display back to you. The web mainly contains HTML documents, but can also have many other things including images, videos, PDFs, etc.
					</div>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-1-2">HTML</h3>
						<p>HTML stands for <em><b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</em>. HTML is made up of:
						<ul>
							<li>text content - what you see</li>
							<li>markup - what it looks like</li>
							<li>references to other documents - e.g. images and videos</li>
							<li>links to other pages</li>
						</ul>
						<p>A HTML <em>element</em> is made up of an opening tag followed by the content and a closing tag. A void tag is a type of tag that has no content.
						<p>Another thing to note is that any <u>whitespace</u> in HTML will automatically turn into a <u>single space</u>.
					</div>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-1-3">Tags and Elements</h3>
						<p>There are many different <em>tags</em>, which define the way the content looks and what it does. Most tags have an opening and a closing tag, which determines where to start and end the function of that tag. All tags begin with a &lt; and end with a &gt;.
						<p>Below are some examples of tags are and their functions:
						<ul>
							<li>&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; - makes characters <b>bold</b></li>
							<li>&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; - makes characters <i>italic</i></li>
							<li>&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt; - <u>underline</u> characters</li>
							<li>&lt;br&gt; - inserts a break and starts a new line</li>
							<li>&lt;img&gt; - displays an image from a specified link

					<h2 id="lesson-2">Lesson 2 - Creating a Structured Document</h2>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-2-1">Why HTML and CSS?</h3>
						<p>HTML and CSS are good languages to learn for an introduction to programming. This is because HTML and CSS readily translates codes to something that is visual, making it easy to learn. The logic and processes for writing HTML and CSS will also be useful and applicable to general programming.
					</div>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-2-2">Tree-like Structure</h3>
						<p>HTML documents tend to have nested or tree-like structures. What does this mean? HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. For example, a web page can be viewed as a series of nested boxes, and there can be boxes inside of boxes inside of more boxes.
						<p>Here's a video by Jessica from Udacity to help illustrate this concept:

					<h2 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3 - Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-3-1">What is CSS?</h3>
						<p>CSS stands for <em><b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets</em> and is a style sheet language that is used to describe the way you want your HTML document to look. With CSS, you can group styles together (e.g. with classes) so you can easily re-apply these formatting. This will largely reduce the amount of code you need to write when creating many similar entities on your website.
						<p>Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">here</a> to go to Wikipedia for more information on CSS.
					</div>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-3-2">Avoiding Repetition</h3>
						<p>The key advantage of using CSS is to avoid repetition. Why is this so important?
						<ul>
							<li><b>To avoid errors:</b> Carrying out repetitive action, possibly with minor changes could often lead to errors, even for the most diligent and detailed programmers. After all, we're only human.</li>
							<li><b>To have consistency:</b> Specifying a style through CSS allows for things on your web page to look the same. This will also lead to a more professional finish and look.</li>
							<li><b>Ease of making changes:</b> By having all the styles all in one place, it is much easier and significantly faster if edits were to be made to how things looked on your web page. You don't have to look through and manually apply the same style over and over again in the HTML document itself.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These are very useful advantages to using CSS.
					</div>
					<div class="concept">
						<h3 id="lesson-3-3">Validating HTML and CSS</h3>
						<p>You can go to the following websites to help validate your HTML and CSS codes.
						<ul>
							<li><b>HTML:</b> <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a></li>
							<li><b>CSS:</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>This web page has been validated through these links for both HTML and CSS.
